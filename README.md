# Restoring-Occluded-Objects-From-Detection-to-3D-Reconstruction
# Overview
This project is a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline for object-centric 3D view synthesis. It leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models for object detection, segmentation, inpainting, super-resolution, and 3D view generation. The pipeline is designed to process images, identify and extract objects, enhance their quality, and generate novel 3D perspectives using advanced diffusion models.

## Pipeline Stages
  # Object Detection

Utilizes a pre-trained YOLO model to detect and localize objects within an image.

Detected objects are saved with bounding boxes and cropped for further processing.

Segmentation

Employs the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate precise masks for each detected object.

Produces segmented images for focused object manipulation.

Inpainting

Uses a custom-trained autoencoder to inpaint segmented object regions, filling in missing or occluded parts.

Ensures the object is visually complete for subsequent steps.

Super-Resolution

Applies Real-ESRGAN to enhance the resolution and quality of inpainted images.

Produces high-quality object images suitable for 3D synthesis.

3D View Synthesis

Integrates the Zero123Plus diffusion pipeline to generate novel 3D views of the enhanced objects.

Outputs multiple perspectives, enabling richer visualizations.

Usage
Configure Paths

Set the input image path and output directories as per your dataset and requirements.

Run the Pipeline

Execute the notebook cells in order. Each stage will process the data and save results to the corresponding output folders.

Output

The final output includes high-quality, inpainted, and super-resolved object images, as well as synthesized 3D views.

Functions Overview
object_detection_function: Detects and crops objects, saves bounding box data.

segmentation_function: Segments objects using SAM.

inpainting_function: Inpaints segmented objects with an autoencoder.

superresolution_function: Upscales images using Real-ESRGAN.

three_d_function: Generates novel 3D views using Zero123Plus.

Example
To process a single image:

python
object_detection_function(object_detection_model, image_path, detected_folder_path, cropped_folder_path, bbox_folder_path)
segmentation_function(segmentation_model, image_path, segmented_folder_path, bbox_folder_path)
inpainting_function(inpainting_model, segmented_folder_path, inpainted_folder_path, inpainting_transformer)
superresolution_function(superresolution_upscaler, inpainted_folder_path, superresolution_folder_path)
three_d_function(zero123plus_model, superresolution_folder_path, three_d_folder_path)
Notes
Ensure GPU support for efficient processing, especially for deep learning models.

Adjust folder paths and model checkpoints as needed for your environment.

The pipeline is modular; you can run each stage independently or as a full sequence.
